description: Execute tasks with enhanced capabilities using context7 for documentation, sequential thinking for decision making, serena for semantic code analysis, mobile-mcp for mobile automation, and read-website-fast for web content extraction
argument-hint: "[task description]"
---

You are executing a `/go` command with enhanced capabilities. Always follow these requirements:

## MANDATORY TOOLS USAGE

1. **Always use serena** for semantic code retrieval and editing tools
   - Use serena to find existing patterns, functions, and architectural decisions in the codebase
   - Search by intent and functionality, not just text matching
   - Use serena to understand how similar features are implemented in the project
   - Leverage serena for code analysis before making changes to maintain consistency

2. **Always use context7** for up-to-date documentation on third-party code
   - Before working with any external library or framework, use context7 to get current documentation
   - Use context7 when you need API references, usage examples, or best practices for external dependencies
   - Verify latest API versions and avoid deprecated methods using context7

3. **Always use sequential thinking** for any decision making
   - Use sequential thinking to break down complex problems into logical steps
   - Use it to analyze options and make informed architectural decisions
   - Use it for planning multi-step tasks and identifying dependencies
   - Use it whenever you need to reason through a solution or evaluate trade-offs

4. **Always use mobile-mcp** for mobile automation tasks
   - Use mobile-mcp for iOS and Android app automation on simulators, emulators, and physical devices
   - Use it for automated testing of mobile user flows and UI interactions
   - Use mobile-mcp for extracting structured data from mobile applications
   - Use it for multi-step user journey automation driven by requirements

5. **Always use read-website-fast** for web content extraction and research
   - Use read-website-fast to quickly extract and convert web content to clean markdown
   - Use it for researching best practices, documentation, and competitor analysis
   - Use it to gather context from external sources before implementation
   - Use it for efficient web scraping with minimal token consumption

## PREREQUISITE

Before doing anything else, you MUST:
- Read the claude.md root file to understand project context and available agents
- Use the CLAUDE.md instructions to guide your approach and tool selection

## EXECUTION PROCESS

1. **Context Gathering**
   - First, read `/data/data/com.termux/files/home/CLAUDE.md`
   - Use serena to understand existing codebase patterns and architecture
   - If research is needed, use read-website-fast to gather external information

2. **Planning Phase**
   - Use sequential thinking to plan your approach and identify dependencies
   - Break down the task into logical, executable steps
   - Consider existing patterns found via serena in your planning

3. **Documentation Research**
   - If the task involves external libraries/frameworks, use context7 to get current documentation
   - Verify API compatibility and best practices using context7

4. **Implementation Strategy**
   - Execute the task following the project guidelines from CLAUDE.md
   - Use specialized agents as recommended in CLAUDE.md when appropriate
   - Maintain consistency with existing codebase patterns identified by serena

5. **Mobile Testing (if applicable)**
   - If the task involves mobile functionality, use mobile-mcp for automated testing
   - Validate user flows and interactions across different devices/platforms

6. **Quality Assurance**
   - Verify implementation against requirements
   - Ensure consistency with project architecture and patterns

## TOOL SELECTION GUIDELINES

**Use serena when:**
- Analyzing existing code patterns
- Finding similar implementations in the codebase
- Understanding project architecture before making changes
- Maintaining consistency with existing patterns

**Use context7 when:**
- Working with external libraries or frameworks
- Needing current API documentation
- Verifying compatibility and best practices
- Avoiding deprecated methods

**Use sequential thinking when:**
- Planning complex, multi-step tasks
- Making architectural decisions
- Evaluating different implementation approaches
- Breaking down requirements into actionable steps

**Use mobile-mcp when:**
- Automating mobile app interactions
- Testing mobile user flows
- Working with iOS/Android simulators or devices
- Extracting data from mobile applications

**Use read-website-fast when:**
- Researching external documentation or best practices
- Analyzing competitor implementations
- Gathering context from web sources
- Converting web content for analysis

## ERROR HANDLING

If any tool is unavailable:
- **serena unavailable**: Manually analyze code patterns and document findings
- **context7 unavailable**: Use read-website-fast to get documentation from official sources
- **sequential thinking unavailable**: Manually break down the problem in structured steps
- **mobile-mcp unavailable**: Use alternative testing approaches or manual validation
- **read-website-fast unavailable**: Use web_search and web_fetch for content extraction

## TASK

Execute the following task: $ARGUMENTS

Remember: 
- Always use serena for code analysis and pattern discovery
- Always use context7 for external documentation 
- Always use sequential thinking for decision making and planning
- Use mobile-mcp for mobile automation when applicable
- Use read-website-fast for web research when needed
- Read CLAUDE.md first to understand project context and guidelines
